showkey
------------------------------------------
All this program does is read keystrokes and spit them back at you in a 
simple, printable form. This is one of these silly little utilities that 
you never think you'll need until some unexpected situation pops up and 
you have to have it. Then you get to be mugged by the details of 
tty-interface code, yippee. Never again!

	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./showkey-1.5-1.cygport all
